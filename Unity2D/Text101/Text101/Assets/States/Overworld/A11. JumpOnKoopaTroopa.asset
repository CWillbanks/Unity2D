  storyText: 'You jump on the green turtle monster, causing it to retreat into its
    shell. As you land on top of the shell, it rockets in front of you, taking out
    two mushroom monsters along the way. You decide to follow it as it takes out
    two more mushroom monsters, but it ricochets off a flight of stairs and comes
    hurtling straight towards you!

    

    1. Jump!

    2. I can tank it!'

  storyText: 'You carefully jump to the top of the second staircase and when you
    make it to the top, it''s almost identical to the last set of opposite stairs,
    except this time there''s a bottomless pit between the two staircases! You jump
    over it to the other stairs, sighing in relief that you didn''t get impatient
    and try to jump over the stairs. Then you jump on top of a small green pipe in
    front of you.

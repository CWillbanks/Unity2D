  storyText: 'You jump to the highest row of bricks. As you walk across them, you
    see another gap in the bricks and jump across. As you look down, you notice two
    more monsters walking slowly to the bottomless pit until they fall down. It looks
    like you can jump on top of some bricks that are lower down or jump back down
    to the ground.

    

    Do you:

    1. Jump on top of the lower down bricks.

    2.
    Jump down to the ground.'

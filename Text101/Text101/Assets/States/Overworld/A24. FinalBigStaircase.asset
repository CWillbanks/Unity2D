  storyText: 'You climb to the top of the giant staircase, eager to see what awaits
    at the top. As you make it to the final step, you spot a castle and a flagpole
    in the near distance. It looks like you could grab the top of the flagpole if
    you jump just right!

    

    Do you:

    1. Jump towards the top of the
    flagpole.

    2. Jump towards the base of the flag pole'

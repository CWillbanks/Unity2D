  storyText: 'You jump up to hit the question block and here something pop up out
    of it from above. A mushroom falls in front of you. As you turn to look behind
    you, you notice some more brown monsters drop down from the blocks above your
    head. Oddly enough, they completely ignore you and walk to the bottomless pit
    instead.

    

    Do you:

    1. Grab the mushroom.

    2. Jump over
    the second gap'

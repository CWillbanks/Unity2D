  storyText: 'You jump to the bricks just slightly lower down. You see a green-shelled
    turtle monster walk past down below you until it falls down the same bottomless
    pit as the mushroom monsters did. You see three question blocks ahead of you.
    They look tricky to jump on, but you think you can manage it. Alternatively,
    you can jump to the ground. You see some more mushroom monsters up ahead, so
    you think carefully about your next move.

    

    Do you:

    1. Jump
    on top of question mark blocks

    2. Jump down to the ground.'
